> main argumentation & def for opacity: [[digital opacity]]

### Technical solutions
There are lots of possible technical solutions!

**Differential Privacy**
Mostly from this talk by [[hal triedman - wikimedia foundation]] through Reboot

**AT Protocol**
As outlined [here](https://atproto.com/), 

### Discursive solutions
But I think that technical solutions don't solve everything because
1. They often apply opacity in a physical / biometric sense, against FRT for example, instead of for opacity for our online/digital selves
2. We need to solve a current discursive divide between the public and the private / citizen and the consumer, especially in our [[digital platform-based public sphere]].
