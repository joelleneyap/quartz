Hello, friend! Thank you for stopping by. 

I'm [[Jolene, Jo-Ellen, Joel-lene|Joellene]], and I graduated from UC Berkeley with a double major in Media Studies and Data Science in May 2024. I'm embarking on the early stages of my career right now, but wanted to find an avenue to continue nourishing my academic and personal growth! This digi-journal is thus a space for [[the Garden & the Stream|exploration over consumption]], for me to build [[you are the glue-sticked collage|a collage of myself]] and my ideas on the open internet, to show my work and my journey, and to increase my [[luck (probability)|luck surface area]].

Take your time, and take a stroll! Some pointers for places to start:
* More on my [[structure & practice]] on this digi-journal site
* Why grounding digital work in the [[Visu-all?|material and physical]] is so important to me, and what that has to do with [[maintenance over innovation]]
* Some polished [[page|essays]] on digital mediums and science & tech studies
* [[diary|Personal reflections and musings]]

If you're up for anything, feel free to hop through the nodes on the graph at the bottom of this page!

Also, I'd love to chat with anyone who wanders through here. Reach out at jyap@berkeley.edu!
