## 3 main tenets for corporate colonialism, exploitation & domination
1. Empirical scientism ~ Detachment & superiority: “see oneself as separate from nature, and thus regard natives as less than human. ”
	1. EG: “the New World was “virgin land,” awaiting settlement by white Europeans.”
	2. [[empirical science -> capitalism]]
2. Extraction
	1. “The more value is extracted, the fewer opportunities people have to create and exchange value through any means other than participating in the systems of domination and control that have robbed them in the first place. ”
	2. EG: “British West India Company. Colonists were permitted to grow and pick cotton, but they were supposed to sell their bales directly to the company at set prices. The company shipped the cotton all the way back to England where it was made into fabric or clothing, then shipped and sold it back to the colonists at a profit.”
3. Relentless pursuit of growth
	1. “this whole drive toward colonial expansion was instigated by the underlying math of interest-bearing currency. Everything is predicated on paying back more than is borrowed.”
	2. EG: mistake growth for economic health, GDP
