“The mosquito nets sent to Zambia and Nigeria by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to protect people from malaria ended up poisoning local fisheries. Instead of using them to shield their beds from insects, villagers brought them to ponds and streams to use as fish nets. The tight weave caught tiny juvenile fish, devastating the reproductive cycle. The insecticide on the nets killed everything else, rendering the water unpotable as well.”
